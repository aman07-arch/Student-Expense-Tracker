# Personal Expense & Budget Tracker

## Overview
Personal Expense & Budget Tracker is a command-line Python application that helps a user record their daily income and expenses, set a personal budget, and instantly see how much they have spent, earned, and how much budget remains. It removes the need for manual notebook tracking by storing every transaction in a local JSON file, so data is never lost between sessions.

This project was built as part of the "Introduction to Problem Solving and Programming" course to demonstrate core programming concepts: variables, loops, conditionals, functions, dictionaries, lists, and file handling.

## Features
- Add an expense or income entry with date, category, amount, and description
- View all recorded transactions in a readable list
- Set and update a total budget
- Automatically calculate total spending, total income, and remaining budget
- View category-wise spending totals (e.g. food, travel, rent)
- Delete a transaction by its number
- Persistent storage using a local `expenses.json` file
- Simple menu-driven interface that runs in the terminal

## Technologies / Tools Used
- Language: Python 3
- Built-in Library: `json` (for saving and loading data)
- Storage: Local JSON file (`expenses.json`)
- Interface: Command-line (terminal-based menu)
- No external/third-party libraries required

## Steps to Install & Run the Project

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system
- A terminal / command prompt

### Installation
1. Clone or download this repository:

git clone <your-repository-link>

2. Navigate into the project folder:

cd personal-expense-budget-tracker


### Running the Project
Run the following command in the project folder:

python main.py
or, depending on your system:
python3 main.py

On first run, since no `expenses.json` exists yet, the program will start with an empty transaction list and a budget of 0. A new `expenses.json` file 
will be created automatically the first time you add data or set a budget.
## Instructions for Testing
The program can be tested manually by running it and using the menu options:

1. **Test adding a transaction**
   - Choose option `1`
   - Enter type as `expense`, a date, category, amount, and description
   - Confirm the message "Saved successfully" appears
   - Choose option `2` to verify the entry appears in the list

2. **Test invalid input handling**
   - Try entering a non-numeric value for amount → program should show an error and not crash
   - Try entering a type other than `expense`/`income` → program should reject it

3. **Test budget calculation**
   - Choose option `3` and set a budget (e.g. 5000)
   - Add a few expense and income entries
   - Choose option `4` to confirm total spending, total income, and remaining budget are calculated correctly

4. **Test category totals**
   - Add expenses under different categories (e.g. food, travel)
   - Choose option `5` and confirm totals are grouped correctly by category

5. **Test delete functionality**
   - Choose option `6`, view the list, delete a valid entry number
   - Try an invalid/out-of-range number → program should show an error, not crash

6. **Test data persistence**
   - Add a few entries, then choose option `7` to exit
   - Re-run the program and choose option `2` → previously saved entries should still be there

7. **Test exit**
   - Choose option `7` and confirm the program saves data and closes without errors
